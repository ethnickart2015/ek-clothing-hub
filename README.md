# EK Clothing Hub — Minimal Catalog (GitHub Pages)

This is a minimalist, mobile-first static catalog template designed for GitHub Pages.
It includes a clean responsive layout and single-click WhatsApp ordering links.

## Quick setup
1. Replace `wa.me` links in `index.html` and in the product buttons (`91XXXXXXXXXX`) with your WhatsApp Business number.
2. Replace `logo.png` (in this package) with your real logo (keep the name `logo.png`).
3. Add product images under `images/` and update `products.json` to match file names.
4. Commit the repository to GitHub.
5. Go to repository Settings → Pages → Source: `main` branch → `/root` and Publish.
6. Your site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

## Files
- index.html — main page
- style.css — styles
- products.json — product data used to populate catalog
- logo.png — logo (replace with yours)
- images/ — place product images here

## Notes
- This template is intentionally minimal to emphasize product images and fast browsing.
- You can later connect a custom domain in GitHub Pages settings.
